If you are having trouble completing it, you can use this notebook to guide you to a solution.\n\n## Describe the Algorithm\nUsually when we start writing a program we decide how we want the program to work. This is called the algorithm underlying the program.\n\nFor hangman it might be something like this.\n\n1. Ask if they want to play a game, if not then return\n2. Generate a random word (w)\n   Also initialize the counter variable which keeps track of their remaining guesses\n   and initialize a variable to keep track of the letters they've guessed already.\n3. Ask the user for a letter and add it to the list of guessed letters\n4. If the letter has already been guessed or is not in the word, add one to the counter\n   and print a message saying they didn't guess a new letter\n5. Otherwise, congratulate them and print the letters in the word, but only showing the\n   letters they have guessed.\n6. If they have guessed all the letters or they have used up all of their guesses end the game\n7. Otherwise continue the game\n\n# Pseudocode\nThe next step is to write the code as a combination of Python and English where the Python\ncaptures the \"top-level\" parts of the algorithm.\n\nMaking this more Python-like we can rewrite it as:\n```python\ndef play_hangman():\n    want_to_play = True\n\n\n    while (want_to_play):\n        guessed_letters = []\n        guesses_left = 6\n        word = \"generate a random word\"\n        letter = \"ask the user for a letter\"\n        done = False\n        while not done:\n            if letter in guessed_letters:\n                \"subtract one from guesses_left\"\n                \"and tell them they already guessed that letter\"\n            elif letter not in word:\n                \"add letter to guessed letters\"\n                \"tell user the letter is not in the word\"\n                \"subtract one from the guesses_left\"\n            else:\n                \"add letter to guessed letters\"\n                \"tell user the letter is in the word\"\n            if \"all the letters in the word have been guessed\":\n                \"set done to be true and tell the user they won!\"\n            elif \"the number of guesses left is zero\":\n                \"set done to be true and tell the user they lost!\"\n            else:\n                \"print the word with a dash for each letter not in guessed_letters\"\n                letter = \"ask the user for another letter\"\n        want_to_play = \"ask the user if they want to play another game...\"\n    \n```   \nSome of the pseudo code can be converted directly into python code\nOther pseudo code should be turned into functions, e.g.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Testing\nTry to trace this program to see if the logic is correct\nPlay a few games and see if we have forgotten anything...","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Topdown development\nNow that we have a highlevel view of the program and have tested it, lets start writing the lowerlevel code.\n\n\"generate a random word\" could be a function call \n```python\n  word = generate_random_word()\n```\nand then you'll need to define the generate_random_word function.
